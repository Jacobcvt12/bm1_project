Based on a simulated mixture of normals, we will investigate the performance of a mixture model. Furthermore, we will explore the use of reversible-jump markov chain monte carlo to estimate the number of components of the model. Finally, we will evaluate the accuracy of this technique, by comparing it to the simulated data with known parameters. Because the underlying distribution of the simulated data is known we can assess our model's statictical properties (such as bias and convergence) and determine how the quality of our approximation improves with more computation time based on the results of MCMC diagnostics. Ultimately the result of this project should be a list of pracatical guidlines regardng sampling and numerical approximation that should be useful for anyone attempting to use reversible-jump MCMC in the future.
